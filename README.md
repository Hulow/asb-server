# Anechoic Station Berlin

## Overview

- Here is a personal project related to Sound Engineering. I am currently building a Anechoic Chamber in a Sovietic Bunker somewhere in Berlin.
- This room is going to be used to make electroacoustic measurements on Sound Systems in order to help people designing better cabinets...
- This application is going to proceed all data recorded from this room:
  - Impulse response
  - Frequency response
  - Impedance response
- This application follows the Hexagonal Architecture pattern introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005 segregating the application & adapters throught different ports.

The documentaton of this project is going to be improved later because the propriety at the moment is to finish building this room. More information is going to be displayed such as a web application made by NextJS
